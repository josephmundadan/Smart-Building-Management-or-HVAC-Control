# ML Classification-Smart-Building-Management-or-HVAC-Control

#Project Objective

The objective of this project is to develop a machine learning model capable of accurately estimating room occupancy using data collected from non-intrusive environmental sensors. The model will classify occupancy levels, including scenarios with no occupants, a varying number of occupants (1, 2, or 3), and over-occupancy situations (more than 3). This solution aims to enhance smart building management by leveraging environmental data such as temperature, light, sound, CO2 levels, and PIR motion sensor readings to provide actionable insights for energy efficiency, security, and space utilization.
